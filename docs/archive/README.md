# Archived Documentation

This directory contains legacy comprehensive documentation that has been superseded by the streamlined operational docs.

## ⚠️ Non-Canonical

These files are **archived for reference only** and may contain outdated information.

**For current documentation, see:**
- [`../1_CORE_FUNCTIONALITY.md`](../1_CORE_FUNCTIONALITY.md)
- [`../2_API_REFERENCE.md`](../2_API_REFERENCE.md)
- [`../3_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](../3_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- [`../4_OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md`](../4_OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md)

## Archived Files

- `App_Summary.md` - Original business/feature overview (replaced by 1_CORE_FUNCTIONALITY.md)
- `Technical_Documentation.md` - Original API docs (replaced by 2_API_REFERENCE.md)
- `App_Architecture_Documentation.md` - Original architecture docs (split across new docs)
- `COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION_BUNDLE.md` - Original mega-doc (split into focused docs)

## Why Archived?

These documents were comprehensive but suffered from:
- **Redundancy** - Overlapping information across multiple files
- **Confusion** - Multiple sources of truth
- **Maintenance burden** - 9 files to update vs 4 streamlined docs
