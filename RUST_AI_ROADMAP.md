## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Rust learning curve | Medium | Low | Start with simple module (color quantization) |
| PyO3 compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Extensive testing, fallback to pure Python |
| AI model accuracy | Medium | High | Hybrid approach (traditional + AI blend) |
| Performance not as expected | Low | High | Proof of concept validates before full commitment |
| Cross-platform build issues | Medium | Medium | Docker-based build system |

### Timeline Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope creep | Strict phase gates, weekly review |
